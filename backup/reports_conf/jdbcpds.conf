     This is the configuration file for the JDBC Query of Oracle Reports.
     In this file, information about the different JDBC drivers, which you 
     want to use, are to be specified. Note the jdbc driver configuration
     format has been changed between 9.0.4 and base 9.0.2 releases. A new
     driver attribute "sourceDatabase" has been added [please refer the detail
     below]  

     Only those JDBC Driver entries that are present in this configuration file 
     will be supported by JDBC Query of Oracle Reports.In the Reports builder's
     JDBC Query Connection Dialog, you will find the list of driver
     names you have specified here and you can select one of them from the 
     drop down list  for a specific JDBC query in your Report.
     
     The entries in this file would be loaded when you create a new 
     JDBC query. If any changes in this configuration file is made, to make 
     them effective, you will have to restart the Reports Builder
     
     This file has two sections, The first being the Internal DTD section
     which  describes the data format of the XML section
     
     The JDBC query will not work if any changes made to this DTD section and 
     you should not modify this section. In case you want to modify them, the 
     corresponding changes needs to be done in JDBC Plugin Datasource java code 
     
     Second section is the XML section where you will typically specify the
     driver information. It is recommended to edit this file and comment the
     unused drivers rather than deleting everything and writing from scratch
     on your own.
     
     The driver information is typically, the driver name, source database
     name, connect string format and the driver class. 
     
     Except the user name, password and database name which you will give
     as connection information for the report, other information which is 
     generic for a driver type will have to be specified here.
     
     Internally, both the connection information you specify with the report
     and the driver information you specify in this file for the driver will
     be combined and a complete connection URL will be submitted to the 
     driver to connect to the database you wanted. 

     Driver attributes :
     name          : Any unique name by which you want to refer a specific 
                     JDBC driver when you use it in Reports 
     
     sourceDatabase: Name of database on which driver would connect. Value of
                     this attribute can be one of fixed set of legal values
                     (oracle, sqlserver, sybase, db2, informix, odbc or other)
                     as specified in the DTD. The value will be used for 
                     calling the stored procedures with correct syntex. In case
                     of "other", you can extend the connection class and mention
                     your class file name and ensure it is set in your class
                     path. The default value would be "oracle"

     subProtocol   : Driver Sub Protocol which will be added with the Database
                     URL before creating Connection with Database. This is 
                     specific to each driver and you can find it in the driver
                     documentation. For instance, for the Merant driver to 
                     the Sybase database is "merant:sybase" and for sql-server
                     database it is "merant:sqlserver"  
                     
     connectString : Specify the format of the connect string of the driver in
                     terms of main Protocol, sub Protocol and the databaseUrl.
                     For example, "jdbc:subProtocol://databaseName" 
                     specifies the format.Please note that, you don't give 
                     the actual values of the subProtocol or the databaseName
                     here. You just use the placeholders ( the name of the
                     place holder are fixed ) to specify the format that your 
                     driver expects. while subProtocol is resolved by the value
                     given in the above attribute "subProtocol", databaseName
                     is resolved by the value given in the connection dialog. 
                                        
                    
     class        :  Driver Class name used to register and load the driver 
                     before using it.This is specific to each driver and you 
                     can find it in the driver documentation.For instance,
                     the driver class name for the Merant data direct driver
                     provided with OracleAS to the Sybase database is 
                     "com.oracle.ias.jdbc.sybase.SybaseDriver" and for
                     sql-server database, it is 
                     "com.oracle.ias.jdbc.sqlserver.SQLServerDriver" 
                    
     connection    : Connection Handling Class for your driver. JDBC PDS can 
                     have separate Connection Handling Class for each Driver,
                     Reports JDBC Query provides a default Connection Handling 
                     class which is sufficient for most of the drivers.The 
                     name of default connection handling class is 
                     "oracle.reports.plugin.datasource.jdbcpds.JDBCConnectionHandling"
                    
                     However if you want to have your own connection handling 
                     you can extend the above class and mention your class file
                     name and ensure it is set in your class path 
                    
     loginTimeout  : If your Driver supports this parameter, you can specify 
                     the value in seconds 
                    
     Property      : You can also specify any additional properties of your 
                     driver by specifying them in Attribute Name and Value
