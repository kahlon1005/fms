 This is the configuration file for the TextQuery of Oracle Reports. In this
 file, information about the different File Formats for which you want the 
 textpds to work is mentioned.

 Only those File Format entries that are present in this configuration file
 will be supported by the Text Query of Oracle Reports. In the Reports builder 
 in the TextPDS Dialog, you will find the list of File Format names you have 
 specified here and you can select one of them from the drop down list for a 
 specific Text query in your Report.

 The entries in this file would be loaded when you create a new Text query.
 For any changes in this configuration file to be effective, the Reports
 Builder needs to be re-started.

 The Text query will not work if any changes are made to this DTD section.
 In case you want to modify them, the corresponding changes needs to be
 done in Text Plugin Datasource java code

 In the XML section, you will typically specify the File Format information.
 It is recommended to edit this file and comment the unused File Formats
 rather than deleting everything and writing from scratch on your own.

 The File Format information is typically, the File Format Name, Comment
 character, Column Delimiter and  File Format type. Each File Format will
 have columns. The individual  Column information is to be given in
 ColumnInfo tag. The Column information are the Column Name, Column Type,
 Cell Wrappers, pattern.

 File Format Attributes:

 name      : File Format Name. This name will appear in the Data Definition
             drop down list. The first File Format appearing in this xml file
             will be the default File Format for Text PDS.

 comment   : Comment character. This will be used in the DataSource. The
             lines beginning with the comment character will be ignored.

 delimiter : Column Delimiter. The Data Source file will have data in rows.
             Each row will have fields or tokens corresponding to the Columns 
             specified in the configuration file. Each field or token will be 
             separated by a Column delimiter(See cellWrapper). If the value of 
             delimiter is "default" then it will mean that delimiter will be 
             one of the characters from the "default delimiter set". The 
             "default delimiter set", is "\t\n\r\f": the space character, 
             the tab character, the newline character, the carriage-return 
             character, and the form-feed character. Delimiter characters 
             themselves will NOT be treated as tokens. Hence the value of the 
             field cannot assume any value from default character delimiter 
             character set.

 type      : File Format Type. Can be fixed or variable. In case of variable" 
             file format, the columns width is variable. In case of "fixed" 
             file format, the column width is fixed and is specified using 
             the attributes "startpos" and "width" for each column. The Column 
             Delimiter is ignored in case of "fixed" file format type.

 nullValue : Null value character.

Column Attributes:

name         : Column Heading

type         : Column Data Type. Currently, 3 data types are supported -
               String, Number, Date.

cellWrapper  : This attributes is optional. If specified, this character will
               override the File Format delimiter for the column for which it
               is specified.
pattern      : This attributes is optional.Currently used only for date fields. 
               Specifies the pattern in which date field is to be expected.
